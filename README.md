# MEP Book Network

This is a webpage that makes two [d3](http://d3js.org) force-layouts of a library dataset.

In one force-layout, library members are linked by books they have both taken out, weighted by how many of the same books.

In the other, books are linked by being taken out by the same members. Linked similarly.

It is meant for use in the [MEP](http://mep.princeton.edu) project at Princeton
University and will eventually use their real data. For now, the data is
randomly generated.
